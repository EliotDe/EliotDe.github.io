## About Me

I am a third year BSc -- and prospective MSc -- Computer Science student at the University of Exeter with a strong interest in subjects across the field; from deeply theoretical areas to practical problems at the frontier of computing. 

Current interests focus on private distributed systems and resource efficient computing closer to the edge; this is reflected in my two ongoing projects: my dissertation and a baremetal embedded project (listed below). However, I continue to enjoy exploring other areas of computer science that may be considered less relevant in the current technological landscape. 

Ultimately, I am eager to apply myself, and the skills and principles I have learned, to build something of importance and address pressing problems in the world today.

## Current Projects

### Privacy-Preserving FL-based IoT NIDS (ongoing)
**Short Description:** This is my final year dissertation. The aim is to build a model and privacy-preserving framework that addresses the performance tradeoff in secure FL systems -- with a particular application to intrusion detection in IoT networks.

**Focus:** Federated Learning / Differential Privacy / Intrusion Detection.

### CrisisSense: A Baremetal Environmental Sensor (ongoing)
**Short Description:** Exploring embedded systems by designing and building a prototype for a low-power IoT sensor. This project aims to use a low-power stm32, a bme280 sensor and a LoRa module to periodically transmit environmental data. Eventually I would like to expand to LoRaWAN.

**Focus:** Internal Communication Protocols, Embedded-C, LoRa.
